@article{ibm_autonomic_computing,
  abstract = {A 2001 IBM manifesto observed that a looming software
complexity crisis -caused by applications and environments that number into the
tens of millions of lines of code - threatened to halt progress in computing.
The manifesto noted the almost impossible difficulty of managing current and
planned computing systems, which require integrating several heterogeneous
environments into corporate-wide computing systems that extend into the
Internet. Autonomic computing, perhaps the most attractive approach to solving
this problem, creates systems that can manage themselves when given high-level
objectives from administrators. Systems manage themselves according to an
administrator's goals. New components integrate as effortlessly as a new cell
establishes itself in the human body. These ideas are not science fiction, but
elements of the grand challenge to create self-managing computing systems.},

@techreport{cloud_computing,
  abstract = {Cloud Computing, the long-held dream of computing as a utility, has the potential to transform a large part of the IT industry, making software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT hardware is designed and purchased. Developers with innovative ideas for new Internet services no longer require the large capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about over-provisioning for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus wasting costly resources, or under-provisioning for one that becomes wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover, companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get results as quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for one hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hours. This elasticity of resources, without paying a premium for large scale, is unprecedented in the history of IT.},
